# Question 1 - Repeat Yourself

Write a function that takes two arguments, a string and a positive integer, then prints the string as many times as the integer indicates.

```python
repeat('Hello', 3)

Hello
Hello
Hello
```

my answer:
```python
def repeat(string, num):
    for number in range(num):
        print(string)


repeat('Hello', 3)
```

quiz answer:
```python
def repeat(string, number):
    for _ in range(number):
        print(string)
```

When solving exercises, it can be beneficial to progress in small increments. We started out by defining repeat with two parameters. Then, to ensure everything worked properly, we added a simple print statement inside the function.

# Question 2 - ddaaiillyy ddoouubbllee

Write a function that takes a string argument and returns a new string that contains the value of the original string with all consecutive duplicate characters collapsed into a single character.

```python
# These examples should all print True
print(crunch('ddaaiillyy ddoouubbllee') == 'daily double')
print(crunch('4444abcabccba') == '4abcabcba')
print(crunch('ggggggggggggggg') == 'g')
print(crunch('abc') == 'abc')
print(crunch('a') == 'a')
print(crunch('') == '')
```
