# Question

Let's do some "ASCII Art": a stone-age form of nerd artwork from back in the days before computers had video screens.

For this practice problem, write a program that outputs The Flintstones Rock! 10 times, with each line prefixed by one more hyphen than the line above it. The output should start out like this:

```python
-The Flintstones Rock!
--The Flintstones Rock!
---The Flintstones Rock!
...
```

# Question

Alan wrote the following function, which was intended to return all of the factors of number:



```python
def factors(number):
    divisor = number
    result = []
    while divisor != 0:
        if number % divisor == 0:
            result.append(number // divisor)
        divisor -= 1
    return result
```

Alyssa noticed that this code would fail when the input is a negative number, and asked Alan to change the loop. How can he make this work? Note that we're not looking to find the factors for negative numbers, but we want to handle it gracefully instead of going into an infinite loop.

Bonus Question: What is the purpose of number % divisor == 0 in that code?
