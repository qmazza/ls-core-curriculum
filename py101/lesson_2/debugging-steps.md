Notes for Lesson 2 for PY101 course.
- Steps for Debugging
  
# Contents

# Reproduce the Error
- Reproducing is usually the first step.
- Becomes more critical as you build sophisticated applications with various external dependencies and moving parts.

# Determine the Boundaries of the Error
- Once consistently reproduced, tweak the code or data that caused the error.
```python
#Example from stack trace earlier was generated by this:
return list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
#We see that a TypeError was raised, with  'NoneType' object is not iterable.

#This suggests that numbers may have a value of None. 

#Why is that the case? Perhaps we initialized numbers from something that returned None if there were no numbers available. If that's the case, we should specifically check whether numbers is None, and return an appropriate value (such as an empty list) if it is.
```
  
# Trace the Code
- Once boundaries of the problem are understood, trace the code.
```python
#New example
def process_student(student_data):
    name = student_data.get('name')
    grade = student_data.get('grade')
    return (name, grade)

def average_grade(grades):
    total = sum(grades)
    average = total / len(grades)
    return average

students = [
    {'name': 'Alice', 'grade': 85},
    {'name': 'Bob'}, {'name': 'Jack', 'grade': 72},
    {'name': 'Jane', 'grade': 75},
]

def collect_grades(students):
    grades = []
    for student in students:
        name, grade = process_student(student)
        grades.append(grade)
    return grades

grades = collect_grades(students)
print(average_grade(grades))
# TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int'
# and 'NoneType'
```
This code: 
- defines two functions process_student which takes a student_data dictionary
- average_grade function which calculates the average grade of all students
- collect_grades function which groups all grades from students.
